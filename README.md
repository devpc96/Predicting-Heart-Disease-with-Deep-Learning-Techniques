# Predicting-Heart-Disease-with-Deep-Learning-Techniques

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using neural networks. By analyzing key health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other patient attributes, we aim to classify individuals based on the severity of coronary artery disease. The dataset used contains information from 303 patients and is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence are set to have a major impact on the healthcare industry. That’s why learning how to work with health-related numerical data and understanding the most common algorithms used for classification is extremely valuable.

We will use some popular Python libraries including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization. For building the Deep learning model, we’ll use scikit-learn (sklearn) and Keras. You’ll need to import these libraries.

The dataset we are using can be found at the University of California, Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

This dataset includes medical data from patients diagnosed with heart disease, collected from multiple locations around the world. It has 76 different features such as age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, results from echocardiograms, exercise habits, and more. However, most research studies only use 14 of these features.
